11/11/21  I started working on the tables for the Adept advances.  There are going to be a lot of tables in this section.  Do I want to load them all at once in the HTML or would this be a good time to revisit AJAX?

11/7/2021 Made some small changes to the HTML to accomidate the new navagation scheme.  Mostly worked on getting git to work with Webstorm.  Made some progress.
Was able to clone from Github but not able to push.

11/5/2021  After doing some reading it seems that AJAX is somewhat over kill for what I'm trying to do so I'm likley to abandon it for loading most of the site.  On the plus side this will make my concerns over navigation and dynamic loading of JS moot.  On the down side this makes the project seem somewhat simpler than I had hoped limiting the learning opportunities.  Still seems a worthy project so I will continue.

10/31/2021 Added jQuery functionality.  I've heard tell that jQuery can be used to dynamically load JS which will be usefull for the dice roll functionality. It also makes the JS much more concise. Three lines to load information with AJAX instead of 8

10/30/2021 Conversion of PDF to HTML is nonviable so I am building the pages from scratch. Loading JS with AJAX is also nonviable will need to research alternate methods. Ajax will work with longer filepaths and not just the folder that index is in.

10/26/2021 First attempt to use AJAX Learned that it is posible to load pictures and HTML files with AJAX
