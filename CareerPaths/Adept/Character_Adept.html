        The Administratum is a vast, monolithic organisation and
        the largest, most powerful of all the divisions that make
        up the Adeptus Terra. It is said the Adeptus Terra is the
        cogs and gears that drive the Imperium, and the Administratum
        is the grease and oil that smooths and coats the machinery.
        Without the Administratum, the gears of the Adeptus Terra
        would grind to a halt and the Imperium would fail.</p>
    <p class="description_content">Billions staff the Administratum, the majority of which are
        adepts of varying grades and specialties. Many are in hereditary
        positions, the titles passed down from generation to generation.
        Such is the immense size of the Administratum, it has been
        known for whole departments to become lost in a sea of
        complex bureaucracy only to resurface centuries later. Entire
        divisions have been founded and dogmatically continue to
        exist, even after their original intent has long since expired.</p>
    <p class="description_content">Most adepts labouring within the gargantuan vaults, forgotten
        archive halls or sitting at ancient, parchment-reading, logic engines
        are considered to be learned by Imperial standards. They range
        from studious librarians, who have spent their entire lives
        within the dusty confines of manuscript-filled archives, to
        younger, knowledge-hungry scholars ambitious to climb
        the multitudinous ranks of the Administratum.</p>
    <p class="description_content">Inquisitors and their agents frequently have
        need of such academics, archivists, curators, scribes,
        logisters, translators, and all manner of specialists in
        lore. Adepts become involved with an Inquisitor in
        many ways: some may already be in service within
        the Inquisition, others may unwittingly cross paths
        during an Inquisitor’s investigation, but the majority
        of adepts are seconded from the Administratum. For
        an ageing scholar, used to a rigid and dogmatic routine,
        entering the employ of an Inquisitor is an intimidating
        experience. Some are reluctant, but see it as an important duty
        that must be fulfilled. Others can become resentful, making
        it clear they are only in service out of fear and loss of status
        rather than any idealist sense of saving the Imperium. Not
        all react negatively: Some, often younger, adepts see it as an
        opportunity, a rare chance to leave the overbearing structures
        of the Administratum and quench their thirst for curiosity, and
        study forbidden knowledge.</p>
    <p class="description_content">In the field, adepts are rarely armed with anything more
        than an autopistol; firepower is someone else’s job. They are
        present to give sage tactical advice, unlock codes, confirm the
        existence of STC data or brief on local customs and rituals.
        Their role may not be in the forefront of a firefight but it
        is no less pivotal or dangerous. Whilst other Acolytes can
        secure a heavily defended data-crypt with firepower and
        psychic force, someone needs to download and decipher the
        data from the terminal in the midst of the combat.</p>
    <p class="description_content">Adepts may be thought of as meek when compared to
        other Acolytes, but they have access to one of the most
        powerful weapons in the 41st Millennium—knowledge.</p>
