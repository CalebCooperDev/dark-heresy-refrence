    <p>Assassins are skilled killers, adept at getting close to a target
    and ending their days. Some are cold-blooded executioners
    that revel in bloodshed, while others are consummate
    professionals who take great pride in their art. Whatever
    their motivations, they represent some of the most dangerous
    men and women of the Inquisition, each one a finely honed
        tool of murder.</p>
