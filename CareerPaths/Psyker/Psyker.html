                instructive beating or blast of untrammelled power that split your head like a Malfian pus-grape. You have large metal plates in
                your head, some of which are clearly visible. Reduce your Intelligence by 3, but gain 5d10 Throne Gelt in compensation.</td>

            <td>Hunted: Your sanction-visions have induced a mild paranoia. You believe certain parts of your psyche, those
                amputated by the sanctioners, have gained sentience and are tracking you down. Whilst part of you realises that
                this is foolish, you still refuse to sit with your back to the door, just in case. Gain 1d10 Insanity Points.</td>
